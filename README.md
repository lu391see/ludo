## How's the game played
The players throw game dice in turn and can advance any of their pieces in the game by the thrown number of dots on the die.

## Rules
The most played variant of the game can be played by 2, 3, 4 players – one player per board side.<br>
Each player has four game pieces, which are in the "out" area when the game starts.<br>
The game pieces must be brought into the player's home row by first moving clockwise over the entire board.<br>

Each game piece enters the circle at the "start" field ("A"), moves (clockwise) over the board and finally enters the "home" row.
Throwing a six means bringing a piece into the game and throwing the dice again.<br>

If a piece cannot be brought into the game then any other piece in the game must be moved by the thrown number, if that is possible. A commonly played variation allows a player who has no pieces in the circle of fields to have three tries to throw a six.<br>

Pieces can jump over other pieces, and throw out pieces from other players (into that player's "out" area) if they land on them. A player cannot throw out his own pieces, and he cannot advance further than the last field in the "home" row. A player can be thrown out if he is on his "start" field.

## Goal
The first player with all of their pieces in their "home" row wins the game.
